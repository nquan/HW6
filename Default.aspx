        <strong>Ever since I saw my mother&#39;s painting of Van Gogh&#39;s </strong> <em><strong>Sunflowers,</strong></em><strong> I have become fall in love with his art work. 
        </strong> 
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Some of the best-known art works are</strong><em><strong> Starry Night over the Rhone</strong></em><strong>, </strong> <em><strong>The Cafe Terrace on the Place Du Forum Arles, At Night, Starry Night, Mulberry Tree, View of Arles with Irises, etc.</strong></em><strong> </strong> 
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I could still feel the excitement when I happened to find several posters of his S</strong><em><strong>tarry Night </strong> </em><strong>and</strong><em><strong>&nbsp; The Cafe Terrace on the Place Du Forum Arles</strong></em><strong> among thousands of other posters in the poster sales on campus.
        </strong>
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Visiting the great Van Gogh Museum is one of my secret dreams. My curiosity and passion drive me to know more about his life and other interesting facts about him through reading his autobiography and his letters with his brother.</strong></p>
    <strong>
    <br />
    </strong>
    <p>
        <strong>His bold application of colors and shapes reflects his unique interpretations of the love, life and the world. 
        </strong> 
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Only by roughly glimpsing through his paintings, the audience will not notice a single sense of sorrow or pain, instead they will never guess these beautiful and colorful works are out of a person who lacks love, comfort and safety for years until the last day of his life. 
        </strong> 
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>He was not a lucky person when he was present, but his name lives forever after his death and riddles with great influence.
    </strong>
    </p>
    <strong>
    <br />
    </strong>
    <p>
        <strong>I believe when he was painting, he hardly thought there would be some people gaining a sense of peace only by looking at his painting for a couple of minutes. 
        </strong> 
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>From time to time, I would pull myself out of the work I am doing, and then look at </strong> <em><strong>The Cafe Terrace on the Place Du Forum Arles</strong></em><strong> for a minute, and then go back to work. I know it is there, which is enough to me.
    </strong>
